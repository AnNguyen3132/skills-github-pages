# Going crazy
But not really

## Up late
But I just have a (severely) shifted sleep schedule

### I'm really just bored
The w3schools exercises take a long time to do and the deadline was way too soon for it.
I'm glad the deadline was shifted by a few more days.
I really wished we had a week between this term and last, though. I guess it makes sense, since that week was like 'borrowed' by Spring Break. Wish it hadn't been, though.
